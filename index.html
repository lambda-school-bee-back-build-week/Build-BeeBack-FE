            <h2>What's Killing Bees?</h2>
            <p>Worldwide bee colony collapse is not as big a mystery as the chemical industry claims. The systemic
                nature of the problem makes it complex, but not impenetrable. Scientists know that bees are dying from a
                variety of factors—pesticides, drought, habitat destruction, nutrition deficit, air pollution, global
                warming and more. Many of these causes are interrelated. The bottom line is that we know humans are
                largely responsible for the two most prominent causes: pesticides and habitat loss. Worker bees
                (females) live about six weeks in summer and several months in the winter. Colonies produce new worker
                bees continuously during the spring and summer, and then reproduction slows during the winter.
                Typically, a bee hive or colony will decline by 5-10 percent over the winter, and replace those lost
                bees in the spring. In a bad year, a bee colony might lose 15-20 percent of its bees. In the U.S.,
                winter losses have commonly reached 30-50 percent, in some cases more. In 2006, David Hackenberg — a bee
                keeper for 42 years — reported a 90 percent die-off among his 3,000 hives. U.S. National Agricultural
                Statistics show a honey bee decline from about 6 million hives in 1947 to 2.4 million hives in 2008, a
                60 percent reduction. The number of working bee colonies per hectare provides a critical metric of crop
                health. In the U.S. — among crops that require bee pollination — the number of bee colonies per hectare
                has declined by 90 percent since 1962. The bees cannot keep pace with the winter die-off rates and
                habitat loss.</p>

            <h2>Pesticides and Bees</h2>
            <p>Biologists have found more than 150 different chemical residues in bee pollen, a deadly “pesticide
                cocktail” according to University of California apiculturist Eric Mussen. The chemical companies Bayer,
                Syngenta, BASF, Dow, DuPont and Monsanto shrug their shoulders at the systemic complexity, as if the
                mystery were too complicated. They advocate no change in pesticide policy. After all, selling poisons to
                the world’s farmers is profitable. Furthermore, wild bee habitat shrinks every year as industrial
                agribusiness converts grasslands and forest into mono-culture farms, which are then contaminated with
                pesticides. To reverse the world bee decline, we need to fix our dysfunctional and destructive
                agricultural system.</p>

                <h2>Solutions That Save Bees</h2>
                <p>Common sense actions can restore and protect the world’s bees. Here’s a strong start:
                    <ul class="solution-list">
                        <li>Ban the seven most dangerous pesticides.</li>
                        <li>Eat Bee bee-friendly or organic.</li>
                        <li>Protect pollinator health by preserving wild habitat.</li>
                        <li>Restore ecological agriculture.</li>
                        <li>Provide a honey bee-friendly habitat in your yard or other outdoor spaces.</li>
                        <li>Don't kill bees.</li>
                    </ul>
